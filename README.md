# Tanouchi-inference
We show using maximum likelihood inference (in Julia) that bacterial proteins are kept at an approximate homeostasis.

Go through the ipynb's in numerical order to understand the project. We find that it is the combined transcriptional/translation rate of the proteins and not the burst size that scales linearly with the volume. All experimental data used comes from: Tanouchi, Yu, et al. "Long-term growth data of Escherichia coli at a single-cell level." Scientific data 4.1 (2017): 1-5.
